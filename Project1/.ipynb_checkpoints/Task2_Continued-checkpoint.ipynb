The treatments seems to be somewhat effective, since less people have symptoms after the treatment than before. 2. There are few of the patients who actually experienced symptoms. This is an important observations since it means that the process for fitting the model will be difficult. For example, only 5 persons had symptoms with their stomach before treatment, and only 3 after. This is out of 877 observations, so we have to work to get a model who does not simply predict \"0\" all the time. We are going to get back to this point. "

    "By these numbers alone we can establish a few things. Firstly, the group that got no treatment has no reduction in symptoms before and after, which makes sence. By this observation, and the fact that there are that the treatments reduces or keeps the number of symptoms the same in every case, we can establish that the treatments are somewhat effective. For headache, every treated person, with every treatment lose their headache. Treatment1 treats all of the Blood Clots cases, and many of the Pneumonia cases. For the rest of the cases, the treatment are either someowhat effective or not effective at all. This is good to note, because if we consider our final model to be good, it should pick up some of this. Fitting the model will be difficult however, since we have very few positives in the response. Finally, we observations that got both treatments, who are \"ressurected\", meaning that they where dead before the treatment, but not afterwards. We think this is a mistake in the dataset. "
