## Ethical concerns
We would like to address the ethical issues in this study. We assume that this study was done
to investigate the efficiency and possible side effects of vaccines and the results of it
will benefit the society we live in.

## Consent to participate in the research
This is an observational study, where the independent/response variable is not under the
control of the researcher. An observational study uses observational data, which refers to
information gathered without the presence of the subject of the research. In this study,
the subjects of the research are patients. We do not have information about whether the
data collection was ethical or lawful, or the subjects of the research consented to be a
part of the study. In order to address the ethical issues, we are going to make some
assumptions about the sampling methods and the subjects of research. If the patients have
agreed to participate in the research, or have been informed that their health data would
be used later in a research, have been informed about the purposes of the research and
the research procedure, and have given their consent in a written, lawful way, then
the data collection method is ethical and correct. If someone has hacked their way into a
hospital database in order to conduct this research and gathered information without the
consent of the individuals, then the patients' privacy and right to have safe health care
has been violated, and this research is highly unethical and unlawful.

## Privacy of the personal information
The data do not contain personal information such as name, family name, date of birth etc.
This indicates that the privacy of the subjects of research was somewhat protected as we
are not able to trace back to individuals by simply looking at the data. However, the data
contains information about the age, gender and income of the patients. None of these are
considered as personal data, but a combination of  “innocent” data can be used to identify
the patient. If the data belongs to the database of a hospital in Europe and fits the
GDPR, there should not be any problem about privacy in this study and the privacy of the
is protected patients.

## Justice and fairness
An important ethical principle in research is justice. The researcher must be fair to the
participants and the participants’ needs must always come first. The participants must be
treated equally throughout the study. The participants must be chosen such that the
research population represents our society, i.e having 50% men and 50% women, including
people who belong to different racial groups, minorities or cultures, including people
with different socioeconomic or academic backgrounds, etc. The researcher must also make
sure that people included in the research should not be included only because they are a
population with high accessibility, availability or simply because they belong to a
vulnerable group, such as children, elderly or mentally ill people, that are less able
to decline an invitation to participate in the research. If the sample data belongs to a
population that represents the society we live in, includes all genders, races and
minorities, and if the researcher does not take the advantage of vulnerable groups, then
we can say that the research is quite fair and just to its participants. If the researcher
has gathered data from a population that belongs to a specific minority or of specific
gender which has higher accessibility, or from people that are confined to an institution
(i.e prisons, mental health hospitals, children's homes, retirement homes) without
respecting or protecting their autonomy, then the research is highly unfair to its
participants.
