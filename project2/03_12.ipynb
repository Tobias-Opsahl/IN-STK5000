    "# General information\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, let us introduce our policy. We will look at treaments, and not vaccines.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Utility\n",
    "To calculate the utility, we look at each person, their symptoms, treaments and outcomes. For each person we calculate the reward, and the utility is simply the sum of the rewards. The reward is calculated by looking at each symptom. \n",
    "If the symptom was there prior to the treatment given, and not afterwards, a positive weight is added. If the symptom was not there before the treatment, but was there afterwards, a negative weight is added, times a penalty. Finally, if any treatment was used (it is not the case that no treatments where used), a treatment-cost is subtracted from the reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Policy overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We will provide a short overview of the policy here. The actual code should be pretty well documented, so you can find more details in the doc-strings. \n",
    "\n",
    "The policy takes the amount of treatments as an argument in the **constructor**, which we assume to be 3 for compatibility with the **simulator.py**. The method **observe()** takes in a poluation (features), actions and outcomes, and fit the models used to predict the outcomes. Note that one would need the population, the actions and the outcomes from treating the poluation with the actions (by using **population.treat()**), before calling the method, since they are required as arguments. To chose the actions for the initial call, one can use **initialize_data()**, to pick actions randomly, and getting the corresponding outcomes. For each treatment, for each symptom, we fit a logistic regression model. Given a treatment and a symtpom, the model takes in some columns from the features as input, and returns the probability for that symptom to be present after the given treatment. \n",
    "The method **feature_select()** will chose the columns we want to fit the model on. This is the given symptom, age, income, gender, and the comorbidities. We do not select the other symptoms, because we assume they are not realated. We do not use the genes, becuase after our analysis they seem to be unrealated to the response, and adds a lot of noise.\n",
    "**get_reward()** calculates the individual reward for each person in features, and **get_utility()** is the sum of the rewards. This was explained in the introductions and there are more details in the code. \n",
    "**get_action()** will chose a suitable treatment for each person in features. Note that **observe()** should have been called first. We use the fitted models to predict the probability of symptoms after a treatment, for each treatment. We then use the probability for symptoms as a response to **get_reward()**, to calculate the expected reward. For each person, we chose the treatment with the highest expected reward. If all of the treatments gives negative expected rewards, we chose no treatment. \n",
    "\n",
    "The help functions **add_feature_names()**, **add_action_names()** and **add_outcome_names()** sumply converts features, actions and outcomes to a pandas dataframe, with suitable column-names. \n",
    "\n",
    "**treatments_given()** checks how many persons recieved at least one treatment. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also make a class **ZeroModel**, to only predict zero if the response is only zero. This is because **LogisticRegression** does not work when all of the responses are zero."

We can randomly chose a fraction of the data and add noise to it. This way, even if the data was publicly available, one would not be certain if the it really was true. The goal would obviously add a fraction of noise that makes the data private enough, but do not lower the predictions significantly. \n",

For the binary data, the function randomize() choses a ratio \"1-theta\" from a column, and changes it with a coinflip (50-50 chance of 0 and 1). For the continious variables, we replace the coinflip with the same data pluss an addition drawn from the Laplace distribution.\n",

We were not sure wether or not to add symptoms. By calculation the utility with the privatized X and the actions that was got from them, it would drasticly change the utility. For example, let's say that our noise happend add a lot of symptoms. Then this would artificially make our model look way better than it actually would be, since they would be, since it would look like it removed a lot of positive cases. The utility is calculated directly on the pre-symptom, action and post-symptom, so we did not want to add noise here. However, if we would send in a non-privatized X, and the actions found on the privatized X, one would need to original data to calculate the utility, and that would require a lot of information loss. Therefore, we preffered not to add noise to the symptoms. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the second approach, we simply fit the model on the data, then sends the outcome columns to the functions to add noise. We will do this two ways. First, we simply shuffle a persons actions with a \"1-theta\" probability. This may change the treatment a treated person is given, but it will not change a non-treated person, since all of their action-columns will correspond to 0. Therefore, we secondly draw 1, 2, 3 or no-treatment, with a 1-theta probability, for each person. "

Since the actions are fitted on the *privatized data*, the actions match the data with respect to the symptoms, since we did not randomize these. The sensitive variables may be a lot of noise. For the privitazed data, we first fitted the actions on the original population, then privatized the results. We think that the logistic regression model might adapt to the randomization in X better than shuffling the predictions. Either way, privatizing X also allows for better privacy, since then we do not leak information when we update our actions, and we do not need our original X for calculating the utility. Therefore, we prefer the method of adding the noice to the data of the patients. "

However, the number of people with high income who received Treatment 1 is greater than the number of people with low income who got the same Treatment. Similarly, there are more people with low income who received Treatment 2 and 3 than people with high income. Overall, there is little bias for `Income`."

Here $\\hat{y}$ is our expected outcome, the treatment we give (including no treatment), and $z$ is the sensitive data, put in two grups. With the $\\min$ function, we chose the one that is less or equal to 1. However, we drop the $\\min$ function, so that we can see which group corresponded to having more or less treatments. We can interpret this score as equality of outcome. If it is far from 0, it means that we have treat the $z$ group have different outcomes, meaning that they get different treatments. \n",

For age and income, we must split in two groups. Since the data is not uniformly distributed, we split the data at the median, to get two different groups, below and above the median. \n",

If we would have traded fairness for utility, we would first look at which variable are \"discriminated agianst\". For example, let say far less females gets assigned a treatment than males. To adjust for this, we could set the threshold for females to get a positive and negative reward could be set to higher or lower. The reward function looks at how likely a sick person is to get cured, and opositite. The logistic regression returns a probability for wether a sick person will get cured. If this probability is below 0.5, we assume that it predicts that the person will be cured, and assign them a positive reward. The reward is later used for assigning treatments. We choose the treatment that is corresponding to the highest reward. If we were to set the threshold for the probability for women to for example 0.7, then more women would be considered cured, and they would get more treatments. This would balance the fairness. This threshold parameter could then be balanced against the total utility in some algorithm. "

We therefore can not meassure the action, like in the last paragraph, since we need to know the true outcome. We also have to have an action as *given*.

If we were to use 877 rows for our data, there would be a lot of responses that is zero for all inputs, so the model will do pretty poor, and also have a negative utility.

This estimate is very optimistic, because the expected utility is calculated on what the model predicts will happen after the treatments, which is also the treatments we choose.

We store the numbers obtained in a list. Later, we calculate the mean expected utility and the standard deviation of the expected utilities to calculate a 95% confidence interval. We repeat this bootstrapping procedure for the generated data as well, so that we can compare the results. We chose to draw 100 samples, because it would be computationally very heavy to compute for higher numbers.
