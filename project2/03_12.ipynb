    "To calculate the utility, we look at each person, their symptoms, treaments and outcomes. For each person we calculate the reward, and the utility is simply the sum of the rewards. The reward is calculated by looking at each symptom. \n",
    "If the symptom was there prior to the treatment given, and not afterwards, a positive weight is added. If the symptom was not there before the treatment, but was there afterwards, a negative weight is added, times a penalty. Finally, if any treatment was used (it is not the case that no treatments where used), a treatment-cost is subtracted from the reward.\n",
