    "# Changes\n",
    "\n",
    "We did some changes from the last assignement. Firstly, we specified our utility function. We now define utility as the following: For each symptom, if the patient _did_ experience the symptoms before, but not after the treatment, a positive weight is added. If the patient _did not_ experience the symptom before, but did after, there is a negative weight added. The weights are corresponding to the severity of the disease, and they are taken from the code sceleton. Finally, if an action is used, a negative constant is added. This symbolizes that the treatment is not free. This allows us to not treat poeple that are completely healthy before and after. \n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, we drasticly changed our model to a more complex one. We think this model is more like what the assignment-creator thought of, but we are not happy with how complex it is. However, we now predict the outcomes rather than the utility/reward. We start by initializing some actions from the RandomPolicy class. Thereafter, for each of the three treatments, for each of the 9 symptoms ('Covid-Positive', 'No-Taste/Smell', 'Fever', 'Headache', 'Pneumonia', 'Stomach', 'Myocarditis', 'Blood-Clots', 'Death'), we fit a logistic regression model to predict if the patient will experience the symptom, given an action (treatment) and given the data. The data is the symptom before the treatment, age, income, gender and the comorbidieties. We remove genes because it only looks like noise in all our tests, and we assume that the symptoms does not affect each other. Then, we chose and action for each person corresponding to the highest expected reward for each person. If all the rewards are negative, we chose no treatment. After getting the actions once, the observe() function can be called again, to update the fitting process on the new features, actions and outcomes. "
