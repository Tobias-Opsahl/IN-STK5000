new_functions.py ->
    Make the new functions for load_dwellings_from_db(), load_dwellings_total(),
    load_transactions_from_db(), load_transactions_for_current(),
    load_sales_from_db(), load_sales_for_current() and load_sales_total(), from
    the old io.py. The functions are created so that they create the same
    output as io.py, but they are made in such a way that one function does
    all the reading, the preprocessing is done in separate places and some
    uneccesary code is removed. It is also a little bit more commmented and 
    structured. 
    
test_file.py ->
    File for testing while making new_functions.py

time_test_old.py ->
    Contains some functions for timing functions, used in test_file.py to test
    new_functions.py.

time_test.py ->
    Contains function for timing other functions, used in test_new.py for 
    testing io_new.py. 
    
io_new.py ->
    New functions for reading and preprocessing. This time, the functions does 
    not run exactly as before, because the earlier functions had some bugs.
    The bugs are now fixed and the preprocessing is a little bit changed. 
    These functions are the ones who are meant to be used in the end. 
    
test_new.py -> 
    File for testing io_new.py. 
    
running_times ->
    Overview of runningtime of new_functions.py against io.py
